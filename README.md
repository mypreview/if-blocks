This block enables you to configure certain content to appear only if specified conditions are met (or be hidden) by setting different visibility rules.

You can add any Gutenberg block inside an if-block, have it render on the front-end of your site only if specified conditions are met. This block also provides an additional area (else-block) that can optionally display an alternative content in place when defined conditions are not met.
